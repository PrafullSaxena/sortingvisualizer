## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Supports a variety of sorting algorithms, allowing users to explore and understand their differences.
- **Interactive Controls:** Users can adjust the speed of the visualization and the size of the array being sorted to see how these factors affect the performance of each algorithm.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** The tool provides a step-by-step visualization of the sorting process, helping users to grasp the underlying logic of each algorithm.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a wide accessibility.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Sorting Visualizer:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   > This will start the visualizer on http://localhost:5173/ by default.

4. **Select an Algorithm:**

   Choose one of the supported sorting algorithms from the list.

5. **Adjust Speed and Array Size::**

   Use controls to adjust the sorting speed and array size to visualize different scenarios.

6. **Watch the Visualization:**

   Click on the "Play" icon to see the algorithm in action. Observe how the array elements move and rearrange themselves step-by-step.

7. **Learn and Experiment:**

   Experiment with different algorithms, speeds, and array sizes to deepen your understanding of sorting algorithms.
